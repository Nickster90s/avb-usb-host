# Licensing — what's covered, by what, and what it means

Short version: **the original code we wrote is Apache 2.0** (see
`LICENSE`). Some imported files keep their original licenses. See
`NOTICE` for the per-component breakdown.

The two specific things worth understanding before reusing this
project commercially:

## 1. `rtl/ulpi_ultraembedded/ulpi_wrapper.v` is GPL — what this means for our actual use

This file is vendored verbatim from
[ultraembedded/core_ulpi_wrapper](https://github.com/ultraembedded/core_ulpi_wrapper)
and carries the **GNU General Public License, any later version**.
The GPL only triggers on *distribution*. Most of the practical use
cases for this project are fine without further action:

### Use cases sorted by GPL risk

- **Private / own use** (the typical case for the project's author):
  no distribution → no GPL obligation. Use the bitstream freely.
- **Renting a hardware unit out** (e.g. EventsLight loans an event
  rack to a venue for the weekend): the GPL FAQ does treat this as
  conveying the embedded software, but with the source already
  published in this public repo, the source-availability requirement
  is met automatically — anyone who wants the source can find this
  repo. Keep the LICENSE / NOTICE / LICENSING.md files visible inside
  the firmware build (already are), and you're done.
- **Open-source release** (this repo, as-is): also fine — the GPL'd
  file keeps its header; everything else combines with it cleanly.
- **Closed commercial product** (selling units, not in this project's
  plans): would trigger the obligation to ship source on request, or
  buy ultraembedded's commercial licence
  (the file header hints at this: *"If you would like a version with a
  more permissive license for [commercial use]…"*), or replace the
  wrapper with a permissive equivalent. Not applicable today; flagged
  here for future-self.

For private use AND rental, the **public GitHub repo is the compliance
mechanism** — you're already done as long as that stays accessible.

## 2. Imported files retain their headers

| File | Upstream | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `rtl/ulpi_ultraembedded/ulpi_wrapper.v` | ultraembedded/core_ulpi_wrapper | GPL (any later) |
| `gateware/usb_descriptors.py` | hansfbaier/adat-usb2-audio-interface | CERN-OHL-W-2.0 |
| `gateware/_ref/*.py` | hansfbaier/adat-usb2-audio-interface | CERN-OHL-W-2.0 |

Don't strip these headers when modifying. Modifications to
GPL/CERN-OHL files are themselves subject to those terms.

## 3. Apache 2.0 covers everything else

That includes — non-exhaustively — `gateware/colorlight_i9plus_platform.py`,
`gateware/colorlight_i9plus_car.py`, all the ULPI-debug tops
(`ulpi_dump_top.py`, `ulpi_force_top.py`, `ulpi_minitest_top.py`,
`ulpi_phasescan_top.py`), `gateware/usb_only_top.py`,
`gateware/usb_utmi_top.py`, `gateware/usb_avb_subsystem.py`, the
channel-stream plumbing, the request handler modifications,
`bitstreams/archive.sh`, the entire documentation set
(`README.md`, including its Amaranth+LUNA+openXC7 lessons section).

Apache 2.0 = use, modify, redistribute (open or closed), as long as
you preserve the LICENSE + NOTICE files and don't claim our trademarks.
Includes an explicit patent grant — important in pro-audio / AVB.

## 4. If you adapt this for your own project

- Keep `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` as-is.
- Add your own `Copyright (c)` line for your changes.
- Preserve every SPDX header in upstream files.
- If you remove `ulpi_wrapper.v` (replacing it), update `NOTICE` to
  drop the GPL line and you can then call the result fully Apache 2.0
  (assuming you also haven't pulled in anything else copyleft).

## 5. Trademarks etc.

This project doesn't claim any trademarks. AVB, Milan, USB, UAC2,
AAF, CRF, gPTP are protocol names; Hive is © L-Acoustics; Auvitran,
MOTU, PCM5102A are vendor names. No affiliation implied.

## 6. Want to suggest a different licence?

Open an issue in `github.com/Nickster90s/avb-usb-host`. The big things to
change would be:

- Replace `ulpi_wrapper.v` (free the project from GPL).
- Switch the whole project to a copyleft hardware licence
  (CERN-OHL-S-2.0) — this maximises community pressure to keep
  derivatives open, at the cost of some commercial-adoption friction.

Either direction would be a real decision, not a paperwork change.
